# Delivery Fee Calculator

This project is a delivery fee calculator that allows users to input their cart value, number of items, distance and delivery date to calculate the delivery fee. It was built using React with TypeScript, Jest for testing, Bootstrap for styling, and Framer Motion for animations.

## Usage

In order to start this project, in the client directory, run:

- npm install
- npm start

The page will be available at http://localhost:3000/ .

I also deployed the app at https://delivery-fee-calculator-zeye.onrender.com/ .

## Testing

In order to run the tests, in the client directory, run:

- npm test

The tests can be found in the tests folder.
I wrote in total 8 test suites including 50 tests:

- render tests
- valid and invalid input tests
- tests for testing the calculator logic

## Conclusion

I have to admit that Typescript and Jest were not completely familiar to me at the beginning of this assignment, but I quickly learned how to use them. It was a really good experience, I came to enjoy using Typescript and writing the tests, and I plan to continue using this new knowledge in my future projects.
I aimed to keep the solution simple in terms of both code and user experience.
