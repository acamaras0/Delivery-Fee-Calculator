# Delivery Fee Calculator

For this assignment I used React with Typescript and I wrote the tests using the JavaScript testing framework called Jest.

I have to admit that Typescript and Jest were totally new to me at the beginnig of this assignment, but I gave my best to learn how to use them on the go. It was a really good experience and I came to enjoy using Typescript and writing the tests.

For the styling I used Bootstrap with a little bit of CSS and Framer Motion for the tiny animations.

## Usage

In order to start this project, in the client directory run:
- npm i
- npm start

The page will be available at http://localhost:3000/ .

I also deployed the app at https://delivery-fee-calculator-zeye.onrender.com/ .

In order to run the tests, in the client directory run:
- npm test

The tests can be found in the tests folder. 
I wrote in total 40 tests: render tests and also tests for testing the calculator logic.
